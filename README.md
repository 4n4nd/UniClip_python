# UniClip_python
# UniClip - Universal Clipboard is an application that lets you share your clipboard over multiple devices.

This is the python version because why not?
JK I hear python has great libraries for clipboard manipulation and I found a good python wrapper for the Google Sheets API.
In this app I plan to use a google sheets sheet as a database instead of making your own database.

Reason: I plan to make another version of this app in python that can work without an internet connection and creates an sql database on the server and other devices can be used as clients for that server. Which is tad bit more complicated than what I have time for now.
